# Practice Projects

1. sum_series_iterative.rb

Iteratively calculate the sum of the integer series from 1 to n. This is similar to the factorial() function, except it performs addition instead of multiplication. For example, sumSeries(1) returns 1, sumSeries(2) returns 3 (that is 1 + 2), sumSeries(3) returns 6 (that is 1 + 2 + 3), and so on. This function should use a loop instead of recursion.

2. sum_series_recursive.rb

Write the recursive form of sumSeries(). This function should use recursive function calls instead of a loop.

3. sum_powers_of_2_iterative.rb

Iteratively calculate the sum of the first n powers of 2 in a function named sumPowersOf2(). The powers of 2 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. In Python, these are calculated with 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, 2 ** 3, 2 ** 4, 2 \*\* 5, and so on. In JavaScript, these are calculated with the Math.pow(2, 1), Math.pow(2, 2), and so on. For example, sumPowersOf2(1) returns 2, sumPowersOf2(2) returns 6 (that is 2 + 4), sumPowersOf2(3) returns 14 (that is 2 + 4 + 8)

4. sum_powers_of_2_recursive.rb

Write the recursive form of sumPowersOf2(). This function should use the recursive function calls instead of a loop.
