# chapter 2

any recursive code can be written as iterative code and any iterative loop can be rewritten as recursive code.

factorial examples: the factorial of an integer is the product of all integers from 1 to n.

factorial of 4 is 4 _ 3 _ 2 \* 1 which is 24. it's written as 4! in math notation.

factorial of 5 is 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 (or 5! = 5 \* 4!)

This is recursive because the definition of the facotrial of 5 (or any number n) includes the definition of the factorial of 4 (the number n - 1). So 4! = 4 \* 3!.
