Code and notes from Al Sweigart's excellent book: The Recursive Book of Recursion

The code in the book is written in JavaScript and Python

My notes and code are in Ruby ðŸ‘€

Why did I rewrite all this code in Ruby? I like Ruby, plus I thought trying to translate these programs into Ruby would make for some good learnin!
